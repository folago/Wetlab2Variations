In order to test the pipeline we decided to use the Coriell CEPH/UTAH 1463  study and the NA12878 dataset. This dataset is commonly  used as a standard reference for genomic benchmarking activities supported by international initiatives such as the Global Alliance for Genomic and Health (GA4GH) and Genome in a Bottle (GIAB).
